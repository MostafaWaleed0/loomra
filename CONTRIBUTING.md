### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side
- Check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/MostafaWaleed0/loomra/issues)

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> **Security Issues:** You must never report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker. Instead, email them to mw.dev500@gmail.com (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details).

If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/MostafaWaleed0/loomra/issues)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section

Once it's filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps
- If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps

### Requesting Features

#### Before Requesting a Feature

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Check if other users already requested something similar in the [feature requests](https://github.com/MostafaWaleed0/loomra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues:
